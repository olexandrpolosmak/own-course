-crud for all models, except order
-ordering
-permissions, i suggest to use only roles, and permission, and also need check how to work with policies, just if they
restrict access where we gonna do something with model it does not make sense.
- sms, realize send sms logic
- events where something happened, may be firebase
- company catalog, all active dished right now
- delivery, check if possible
- promotions
- schedule command, for expire promotion or something else
